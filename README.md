# FitQuest

FitQuest is an interactive online workout game where you can pit yourself against others to see who can have the best and most consistent workouts.

# Why?

FitQuest was made primarily to motivate more people to work out consistently. We wanted to find a way to gameify the workout process, which would hopfully convince people to go to the gym more frequently.

# Installation 

To set up FitQuest on a host server, it requires: 
  -  the Django framework: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
  -  postgresql: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Then simply start the application as you would normally with any other django based application
