Our release goal for this sprint is to implement two of our features: the Quest List feature and the User Profile feature. 

Scope of the project:

We wish to complete the Quest List feature and the User Profile Feature. For the Quest List Feature, we want users to be able
to select quests from a list of quests, which are separated by category. Users should be accept quests and then mark them as complete,
which in term should award points. Users should also be able to cancel current ongoing quests. For our User Profile Feature, we want
to make it so that users are able to see their username and the amount of points they currently have, as well as their current rank and 
the amount of points they need to promote to the next rank. We also wish to implement the log in and sign up functionality, so users
are able to create an account and log in to their account.
