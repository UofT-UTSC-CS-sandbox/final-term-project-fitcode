# Local Setup

To set up FitQuest for development, it requires:

    - python version Python 3.12.3
    - the Django framework: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/. 
    - postgresql: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
    
Then simply start the application as you would normally with any other django based application

The project also uses the React framework. You can use npm and Vite to build and bundle the given React files.
The command below shows instructions on how to install node.js and npm. We decided to use the latest stable npm and node version.

    - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
    
Then, to install React onto our app, we used Vite using the following instructions. Just skip to the Using Vite section:

This should create the initial foundation for our app.
