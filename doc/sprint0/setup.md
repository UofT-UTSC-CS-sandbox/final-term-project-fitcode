# Local Setup

To set up FitQuest for development, it requires:

    - python version Python 3.12.3
    - the Django framework: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/. 
    - postgresql: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
    
Then simply start the application as you would normally with any other django based application

The project also uses the React framework. You can use npm and webpack to build and bundle the given React files.

    - https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
    
and use the npm install command in terminal while in the same directory as package.json to install all required javascript dependencies, including webpack.
