# Product Backlog

1. As a developer, the information filled in for "Create Account" and/or "Login"
should be saved in a state, so we can always get the latest update on information.

2. As a user, I should be able to submit the information filled in by clicking
"Create" button, so I can generate my own account for FitQuest.

3. As a user, I should be logged in whenever I give the right information for
the login and click "Login" button, so it redirects to the homepage with my account
loaded in.

4. As a user, whenever I make a new account, I should start with a default
amount of points, so everyone can start the quests at the same starting point.

5. As a developer, each user must be limited to challenging "x" amount of quests at 
a time, so users can't spam every quest they find.

6. As a user, I should get the points for the quest That I completed the earliest so that
I can increase my ELO.

7. As a developer, each quest must have a different amount of points depending on the 
difficulty and the time limit, so it prevents users from only completing easy quests.

8. As a developer, quests must have varying difficulties, so the quests can challenge
those who are not very active to those are take fitness very seriously.

9. As a developer, quests should target a specific area (ex: back, chest, endurance running, 
short-distance swimming, etc) so it gives users a variety of quests to choose from.

10. As a developer, the completed quest must close right when the points are awarded to
the "winner", so other users challenging the same quest cannot complete the quest anymore.

11. As a developer, each quest must have a time limit, so it gives users a sense of urgency 
and excitement to finish the quest the fastest.

12. As a user, I can accomplish my quest by recording myself doing the quest from 
start to finish, so others can verify that I have finished my quest by clicking the "verify" button.

13. As a developer, each quest must have a "maximum participant limit", so it prevents from 
having too many people crowding one quest.

14. As a developer, each quest must have a "minimum participant limit", so it prevents users
from faking their quest accomplishments.

15. As a registered user, I want to be able to view my challenges completed from previous games, so that I can figure out which areas of my physical fitness I have worked on the most and which areas need improvement.

16. As a registered user, I want to be able to create a private game with a group of my peers, so that I can participate in games where all participants are familiar.

17. As a registered user in the middle of a game, I want to be able to view the point totals of all participants in real time, so that I can strategize my next moves depending on my position on the leaderboard
