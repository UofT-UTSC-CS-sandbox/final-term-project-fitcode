# Product Backlog

1. As a user, clicking on Profile should show my user information, so I can always 
look at my information whenever I want to.

"Create" button, so I can generate my own account for FitQuest.

3. As a user, I should be logged in whenever I give the right information for
the login and click "Login" button, so it redirects to the homepage with my account
loaded in.

4. As a user, whenever I make a new account, I should start with a default
amount of points, so everyone can start the quests at the same starting point.

5. As a user, I must be limited to challenging "x" amount of quests at 
a time, so I can't spam every quest I find.

6. As a user, I should get the points for the quest That I completed the earliest so that
I can increase my ELO.

7. As a user, I should be able to challenge quests with varying amount of points depending on the 
difficulty and the time limit, so it prevents me from only completing easy quests.

8. As a user, I should be able to challenge quests with varying difficulties, so the quests can 
challenge me when I am a beginner to when I become a very active and fit person.

9. As a user, I should be able to challenge quests with varying target areas (ex: back, chest, endurance running, short-distance swimming, etc) so it gives me many different quests to choose from.

10. As a user, I want the quest I completed to close right away, so other users challenging the same quest cannot complete the quest anymore.

11. As a user, I want the quests to have a time limit, so it gives me a sense of urgency 
and excitement to finish the quest the fastest.

12. As a user, I can accomplish my quest by recording myself doing the quest from 
start to finish, so others can verify that I have finished my quest by clicking the "verify" button.

13. As a user, I want quests to have a "maximum participant limit", so it prevents others from 
crowding any one quest.

14. As a developer, I want quests to have a "minimum participant limit", so it prevents others
from faking their quest accomplishments.

15. As a registered user, I want to be able to view my challenges completed from previous games, so that I can figure out which areas of my physical fitness I have worked on the most and which areas need improvement.

16. As a registered user, I want to be able to create a private game with a group of my peers, so that I can participate in games where all participants are familiar.

18. As a user, I want to see how I am progressing relative to my friends, by checking some sort of leaderboard
