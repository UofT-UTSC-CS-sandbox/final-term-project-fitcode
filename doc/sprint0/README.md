# FitQuest

FitQuest is an interactive web based workout game where you can pit yourself against others to see who can have the best and most consistent workouts.

# Why?

FitQuest was made primarily to motivate more people to work out consistently. We wanted to solve the issue of people having unhealthy work/life balances, and we thought that by finding a way to gameify the workout process, people would find more of a reason to stay healthy.

A large part of this decision is the observation that our team made, which is that people tend to be more willing to workout/exercise with friends/family. Following this line of logic, we decided to try turning peoples workouts into an online game where they can pit yourself against others and earn points. Additionally, by providing a points and leaderboard system, people would hopefully find another reason to stay active in earning points and reaching the top of the leaderboards. 

# Installation
