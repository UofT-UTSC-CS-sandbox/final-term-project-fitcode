#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

Our team is planning to build a physical fitness multiplayer game on the web.  As a group, we wanted to attempt to solve the problem of an unhealthy work/school-life balance.  Specifically, we wanted to find a solution to motivate people to workout and maintain good physical health.  One observation our group realized was that people tend to be more inclined to workout/do sports with friends/family.  Going along this obeservation, we are planning to build an online game that allows users to compete against other users to try and gain as many points as possible by performing physical challenges (reaching x number of steps in a single day etc), with the goal of accumulating points to finish atop a leaderboard.  We plan to implement both private and public lobbies, which can allow friend/family groups to compete against each other while also staying physically fit or gym enthusiasts to find a new way to shake up their workout routine.

 * Short (2-5 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?      
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.      
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users? (2-3 personas)

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)), or add a pdf

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (2-5 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)


#### Q4: What does "DONE" means to your Team 
 * The whole team needs to agree as to what ”done” means for the features you will
   implement.
 * Definition of done applies to all userstories

Key Decisions
1) Alternative Ideas - While our team already knew we wanted to build a product related to physical fitness, our original idea was to build a "one-stop shop" for workout planning.  We brainstormed multiple features for this app including but not limited to: a calorie counter, a space for users to share their workout plans, and a forum to ask gym related questions.  However, we decided not to continyeWe ultimately decided to go for the game instead as we wanted to make our project more unique while "gamifying" the application would be more enticing for users.

2) Ranked System - One dillema our team thought of during the planning process was that each person is different in terms of their fitness lifestyle (i.e., some people go to the gym fairly often to do high-intensity workouts while others may only go to the gym once a month to work on light cardio).  Our group decided to think of ways to separate these vastly different users, to understand how our global/public games will operate.  One alternative our team thought of was adding tiers to separate these users into categories.  Specifically, we were considering to divide our player base into 3 main tiers: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.  However, we soon noticed that this structure could still lead to "gaps" and we felt 3 tiers would not provide the most accurate division of the user base.  Our counter-solution was to implement an "ELO" system where users are given points based on past performance and are grouped with users with similar point totals.  This way, it's more likely that an arbritary user will be grouped with user with similar points.

3) Choice of Web Framework - 

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process. Here are few questions that can guide you

 * Short (5 min' read max)
 * Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product plan.
 * How did you organise the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
 * How frequently did you meet?
